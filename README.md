# Who am I?
My day job is working as an OpenStack Product Manager at [Rackspace](https://www.rackspace.com/cloud/openstack).  I have an "outbound" focus on customers, partners, and evangelism.

# What's here...
I am not actually a real developer, but I'm very good at pretending to be one.

Lots of stuff here is experiments, forks, preservation of repos that I use elsewhere, and other misc. stuff...

# What's not here...
Work I do as a Racker. Although you may find [OpenStack](https://openstack.org) stuff here, any work I do professionally is done as [OpenStackKen](https://github.com/OpenStackKen).
